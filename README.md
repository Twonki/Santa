# Little Santa

Hi! 

This repository is intended to be a little christmass secret for some of my friends.
Usually, I come along and hand out huge bags of presents for all I love, but this year I am stuck in quarantine. 

Or, well, something like that, but no big christmass. 

So, I made this repository where I just make a little static website for people to enter gift codes and their password, 
and they see a personal wishes. 

## How ? 

The messages are symetrically encrypted in the JS.

Any happy user gets a code and decrypts it with his password (set by me). 

## Contributing

This is intended for my friends. Feel free to take / copy the idea and you don't even need to tell that you borrowed it from me :P 

But if you want to suprise your friends, please make a fork.
